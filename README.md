# logpy
This is a set of Python codes that create a log file. It allows users to easily write log information with elapsed time and CPU clock time in the log file and it can be smoothly incorporated into users' own codes. Each log information is numbered and ordered. 
	
Users can simply copy either (i) the folder "logpy", or (ii) the file "logpy.py" into the user's current working directory. The log file will be automatically saved in the same working directory when an instance is created - by default.

By default, the log file will be automatically created when the class *logpy* is instantiated with a unique file name (launching time is part of the log file name).

Several examples are provided to show how to use the developed classes for logging purpose. Results for those three examples are also provided for users' convenience.

* A Java version of this logging function is available at: https://rpglab.github.io/resources/Logging-Java/
